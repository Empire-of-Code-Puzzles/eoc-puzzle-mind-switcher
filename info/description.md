Robots have a backup machine for their minds.
This machine can copy a robots mind and has a secret and undocumented function.
The backup machine can also operate as a mind switcher for robots.

And several robots of course swapped their minds, just for fun as they said.

We have a log from the machine, of which robots minds were swapped.
There is however one slight problem - no pair of bodies can swap minds more than once.
However, with two additional bodies we can return the switching chaos back to a normal state of things.
And we have these bodies -- (`"a1"` and `"t2"`).

You are given an array with with information about the recent swaps.
Each entry is a set with two names of robots (bodies).
You can operate with bodies which were written in 
the journal and with two additional bodies - `"a1"` and `"t2"`.
Find the sequence of the swaps required to return all minds to their original bodies.
The result should be represented as a sequence of arrays with two names in each.
